### Development Guidelines
The project uses a mixture of Cucumber and JUnit tests. When implementing a new feature or bugfix, please add appropriate test coverage before sending along a Pull Request.

#### Code Structure
When implementing a new feature or bugfix, you want to ensure the you have appropriate test coverage. Here is an example of the code structure for a single feature (UsagePoint REST API).

* **Write a Cucumber feature test**
    * [Feature](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-DataCustodian-java/blob/master/src/test/resources/features/API.feature)
* **Implement the Controller**

* **Implement the Repository Layer**
	* [Implementation](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-Common-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/greenbuttonalliance/espi/common/repositories/jpa/UsagePointRepositoryImpl.java)
	* [Integration Test](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-Common-java/blob/master/src/test/java/org/greenbuttonalliance/espi/common/repositories/jpa/UsagePointRepositoryImplTests.java)
* **Implement the Domain Object**
	* [Implementation](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-Common-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/greenbuttonalliance/espi/common/domain/UsagePoint.java)
	* [Unit Test](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-Common-java/blob/master/src/test/java/org/greenbuttonalliance/espi/common/domain/UsagePointTests.java)
	
*Note that each of the classes linked above reference many other classes that are individually unit and integration tested.*


### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search the [Common module](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-Common-java/pulls), the [DataCustodian module](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-DataCustodian-java/pulls) and the [ThirdParty module](https://github.com/greenbuttonalliance/OpenESPI-ThirdParty-java/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Create a fork of the project you'd like to contribute to.
* Make your changes in a new git branch

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

* Create your patch, including appropriate test cases.
* Commit your changes and create a descriptive commit message:

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```

* Build your changes locally to ensure all the tests pass

    ```shell
    mvn clean install
    ```

* Push your branch to Github:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In Github, send a pull request.
* If we suggest changes then you can modify your branch, rebase and force a new push to your GitHub repository to update the Pull Request:

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
